# Rookie Drive
The Odin Project's Final Javascript Project:

## Story Behind

The website I chose to replicate was Google Drive, a favorite of my fellow Game Design students, but was obviously held back in what I could accomplish in the time period I allotted to finish this project.

## Future Plans

Since I have recently converted to the T3 stack, one of the future projects I may do is a remake of this one, I did work in game development after all and we love those.
